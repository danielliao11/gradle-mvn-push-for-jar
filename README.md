# gradle_mvn_push_for_jar
I used [Chris Banes](https://plus.google.com/+ChrisBanes/posts?partnerid=ogpy0)'s [gradle-mvn-push](https://github.com/chrisbanes/gradle-mvn-push) and modify it for jar to my [gradle_mvn_push_for_jar](https://github.com/saintdan/gradle_mvn_push_for_jar). 
THX Chris!
Maybe you need a complete guide of [Upload your jar to Maven Central with Gradle]().
